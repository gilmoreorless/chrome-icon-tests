# Chrome extension icon tests

A simple [GNDN](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GNDN) extension for Chrome to test which icons are used for particular contexts.

Itâ€™s basically a [test pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_card) for Chrome extensions.

## Background

The [Chrome extension manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/icons) allows you to specify many different icon sizes, and the documentation recommends adding multiple sizes for different screen resolutions. I just wanted to work out which icon sizes were used and where.
